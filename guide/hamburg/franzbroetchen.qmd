## What?

> "A Franzbrötchen is a small, sweet pastry baked with butter and cinnamon, similar to a cinnamon roll.
Sometimes other ingredients are used as well, such as chocolate or raisins.
It is a type of pastry commonly found in northern Germany, especially Hamburg, and it is usually served for breakfast, but is also enjoyed along with coffee and cake."

## Where?

"Where to find the best Franzbrötchen?" is probably the most hotly debated question in Hamburg.

Here are my top-three recommended places:

1. [Die Kleine Konditorei](https://kleine-konditorei.com/)
1. [Bäckerei Hönig](https://baeckerei-hoenig.de/)
1. [Café Luise](https://www.cafe-luise-baeckerei.de/)
