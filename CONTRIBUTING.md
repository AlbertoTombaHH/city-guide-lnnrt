## How to contribute

### Adding a new entry

To add a new entry to the repository, please follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the `guide` folder**:
Locate the `/guide` subfolder in the project directory.

2. **Choose a city folder or create a new one**:
Inside the `/guide` folder, navigate to the city for which you would like to add an entry (e.g., `hamburg`).
If the city does not yet exist, please create a new folder.

3. **Create a new file**:
Create a new `.qmd` file within the city subfolder for your recommendation.
To simplify this process, you can copy an existing entry file as a template or use the [`template.qmd` file](guide/template.qmd) as a starting point.

4. **Add your recommendation**:
Populate the new `.qmd` file with the details of your recommendation.
Ensure that you follow the formatting and structure of existing entries for consistency.
   
5. **Commit your changes**:  
Once you've added your recommendation, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
